# Why

My dad taught me as a child to never throw away scrap pieces of rope, string or chain. You never know when they might come in handy. As an adult, I've added code to the list. This repo is a place for me to keep any scraps or ideas I come up with.

I've decided to include my solutions (good or bad) to coding puzzles from places like, Exercism, Code Wars, Code Signal and HackerRank since they don't really have anywhere else to go but I don't want to lose them, and I feel like they give a good sense of how I think as a coder.
